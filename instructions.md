## PSEUDOCODE

  * navbar that displays score on the top right/ top score - navbar is sticky to the top
  * Clicky Game title on top left that when clicked refreshes the page
  * hero or jumbotron displaying clicky game title.
  * 12 same size square images displayed on screen 
  * when an image is clicked it refreshes the images and displays them in random spots. 
  * if the same image is selected again in any following clicks the screen shakes and "you guessed incorrectly! displays in the navbar is and the game is ended
  * if this is your top score it
 displays in the top score 

  * a new game is automatically started and when you click the first image it tells you you guessed correctly in the navbar.


## Instructions

  * ### The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

  * ### The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

  * ### Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

  * ### Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

  * ### When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
